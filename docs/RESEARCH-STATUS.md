# Research continuation state — 2026-09-13

The ongoing objective is to improve this project's implementation, content
and research with rerunnable evidence. An hourly follow-up is active in the
existing Codex task. It does not bypass account limits; local scheduled work
needs the computer and app available. Check current processes and Git state
on resumption rather than assuming this snapshot is still current.

## Completed and verified

- Research runner: consistent pooled verdicts, preserved initial/recheck
  evidence, append-only resume, concurrent-writer exclusion, atomic JSON
  before journal/Git writes, scoped commits and protected WM hashes.
  `python -m scripts.research_selftest` passes 16 isolated regressions;
  `python -m scripts.research --selftest` passes a simulator-backed dry gate.
- Metrics: shared tie-aware AUC, explicit rejection of nonfinite/mismatched
  inputs, independent holdout export, paired rollout uncertainty and a
  legacy-metric audit. Core, indoor-wrapper, checkpoint, head-calibration,
  temporal-probe and int8-parity selftests passed locally. The real-checkpoint
  CLI export/compare roundtrip also passed identity and no-overwrite checks.
- Registered [metric_integrity_v1](../experiments/metric_integrity_v1/journal.md)
  is complete: 60 rollouts, 4,083 valid samples, zero cross-class ties and
  zero legacy-to-corrected AUC change for both locked float WMs. Do not
  rerun this diagnostic looking for a different outcome.
- The diagnostic exposed world/role schedule aliasing. New generation now
  uses `world_balanced`; explicit `legacy` reproduces older recipes.
  Pure schedule tests cover world permutations/weights; the simulator
  selftest requires passive and intervention flights in every world.
  A separate six-rollout replay matched every array against the old
  `8de0e75` generator. New data/checkpoints carry layout provenance.
- The [evidence audit](RESEARCH-AUDIT-2026-09-13.md), roadmap, README and
  bilingual articles #15–#16 distinguish recorded rows from unproven
  explanations. Historical journal corrections append dated notes.
- Whole-repository Black/Ruff and diff-whitespace checks passed. These
  are local validations, not a claim that remote CI was dispatched.

All nine locked artifacts were restored from the existing release and
verified. Both protected WM hashes remain those in `artifacts.lock.json`.
No frozen skill declaration or existing results JSON was changed. No
release was tagged or remote push performed.

## Next research work

The priority is a **new, pre-registered data-layout comparison**, not more
temporal architecture speculation. First freeze an independent common
holdout and confirm rendered geometry, world/role coverage and label
support. Compare matched controls and candidates on identical code,
architecture, training budget and metric implementation, varying only the
registered data-layout knob. Separate training-draw variation from
test-course uncertainty; record every planned draw and any failed guard.
Neither the current coverage fix nor the float AUC audit establishes a
learned-policy improvement.

The 96-pixel research models/corpora are absent from this checkout and
are not assets in the inspected `champions-2026-07` release. Do not silently
substitute the deployed 64-pixel models for those historical candidates.
A reconstruction or new training study needs explicit recipe provenance
and its own registration; preserve the earlier NO-GOs.

The manual CI workflow includes the new fast integrity/metric/schedule
tests. If a later step pushes this branch, run whole-repository lint and
dispatch CI as required by AGENTS.md. Conditional training stages must
remain gated with `research step` or a fail-fast persistent queue.

Local validation environment for resumption:
`/Users/hans.chen/.cache/microdrone-research-venv/bin/python`
(Python 3.14.5, torch 2.14.0, NumPy 2.5.3, pybullet 3.2.7).
The repo's declared conda/CI Python is 3.12; it was not replaced. New
statistical records include their actual evaluation runtime. Full audit
logs are in the campaign folder; local selftest logs are under
`output/research_integrity_selftest/` and the task's cache directory.
